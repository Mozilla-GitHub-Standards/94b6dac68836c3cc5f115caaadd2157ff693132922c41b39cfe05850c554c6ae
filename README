THEMES/APIs:
At Mozilla, we care about technology that advances the Web for everyone, while keeping it open, decentralized,interoperable, people-centric, and fun. These WSOH challenges are proposed in that spirit. After all, hacking is about scratching an itch, and really, no one else can tell you where to scratch, or what tools to scratch with:

* Build something interesting with HTML 5 & video technology
* Build something that enables cross-device sharing or social interaction
* Data visualization - use data to tell an interesting story in a new way, reveal something new
* Build something interesting that leverages user identity and the social graph
* Build a browser extension (bonus points if it maps to one of the above: social, identity, datavis)
* A vast amount of information online is locked up inside PDFs, Word documents, and so on. Scribd can convert this to pure HTML5 — use the embedding API to expose this information from your favorite data source! (http://www.scribd.com/developers)
* Best use of the V3 API (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/)
* Build something that syncs dropbox with another service (flickr, facebook, gmail)
* Build another interface into dropbox (sftp dropbox server, webdav, fuse, gvfs, browser extension, public share website, twitter-like dropbox webpage)
*  Build something that uses data mashups from the Yahoo! Query Language (YQL) in interesting ways
-The background documentation for YQL is available at http://developer.yahoo.com/yql and the test console is available at http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console]
  
* Hardware hack: using hardware/an unexpected device to do one of the above
* Open challenge: could be anything (be creative!)
